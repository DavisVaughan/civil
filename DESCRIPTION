Description: Provides comprehensive support for local and zoned
    dates and times. A local date does not assume any particular time zone.
    A zoned date is a local date with a time zone attached. Precision up
    to nanoseconds is supported, and partial date types representing
    coarser periods such as months or weeks are also implemented.
