# can't group by finer precisions

    Can't group at a precision (hour) that is more precise than `x` (day).

---

    Can't group at a precision (nanosecond) that is more precise than `x` (day).

# can't group by non-year-month-day precisions

    `precision` must be a valid precision for a 'year_month_day'.

# can only floor by week/day

    Can't floor to a more precise precision.

---

    `precision` must be at least 'day' precision.

# `origin` is validated

    `origin` must be a 'Date'.

---

    `origin` must not be `NA` or an infinite date.

---

    `origin` must not be `NA` or an infinite date.

---

    `origin` must have length 1.
